# Wine Quality Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains a supervised machine learning project focused on predicting wine quality based on physicochemical properties. The project uses the UCI Wine Quality Dataset to demonstrate a complete machine learning workflow from exploratory data analysis through model evaluation.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the Wine Quality dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing red and white variants of Portugese "Vinho Verde" wine. The dataset includes chemical properties like acidicity, pH, alcohol content, and quality rating.

## Features
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Implementation of multiple classificationa algorithms
- Model comparison and hyperparameter tuning
- Feature importance analysis
